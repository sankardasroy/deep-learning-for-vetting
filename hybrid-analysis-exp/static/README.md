### Static Approach

Three methods:
LSTM-only-dynamic-maskZero.ipynb
BI-LSTM-only-dynamic.ipynb
Attn-BI-LSTM-only-dynamic.ipynb

word2vec model needs to be generated separately. It was not included here due to its huge size.
images directory has the confusion matrices for different sets of experiment.
